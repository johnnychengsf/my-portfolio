      <p>About me<br />
As an experienced IT professional, I have implemented, developed, and maintained IT systems and services, consistently delivering high-quality work across applications, programming, testing, support, capacity planning, and quality assurance. I am adept at writing programming codes, identifying and resolving issues, and integrating projects into existing frameworks and processes. Throughout the project life cycle, I have also documented systems.<br />

My projects have included developing a scheduling system for various media formats to TV or LED displays, replacing a passenger information display system with a web-based scheduling system for concourse and platform workstations, and controlling display parameters while broadcasting emergency messages. I have also migrated existing systems to new hardware and environments, configured servers and workstations, fine-tuned display output, and prepared documentation including operation manuals, installation, verification, and fallback documents. Additionally, I have added video streaming features, fixed bugs, and tested and commissioned UDS and LED displays for projects at Lingnan University and MTR Corporation Limited.</p>
